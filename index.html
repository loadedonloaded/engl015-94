<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>English 015 is an intensive, rhetorically-based course in reading and writing. It will prepare students to understand the communications that surround them and to succeed in their own communication efforts. Participants will spend the semester discussing rhetorical principles. They will use these principles to analyze verbal and visual texts produced by their peers and other authors, and they will apply these principles in their own writing.</p>

<p>English 015 is not a grammar course. It will not provide students with pre-designed templates or step-by-step guides for composing essays. Instead, English 015 will help students become more self-reflexive about the writing and communication habits they <i>already</i> bring to the classroom. The course is designed to make students more attuned to their goals as writers; more aware of how they communicate in their day-to-day lives; more resourceful in terms of the appropriate delivery of their information; more conscious of available rhetorical strategies; and more sensitive to the expectations and needs of their audience. Students who commit to earnest and thoughtful discussion, to experimentation and revision, and to critical peer- and self-evaluation will leave English 015 as more confident readers and writers.</p>

      <p>This course will be conducted in a seminar format, and a high participation grade will reflect regular, attentive, and thoughtful contributions to our discussion. Be prepared to ask questions, to make claims about the assigned reading, and to respond to other students' questions and claims.</p>
      <p>Discussion, like any other skill, requires time, patience, and practice to develop. Everyone is coming to this course with different levels of exposure to the course's concepts and with various ranges of experience in analyzing texts. My only expectation is that everyone will try to keep discussions generative and inclusive.</p>
      <p>Students are allowed <b>two absences</b> (the equivalent of one week of class). Additional absences will result in an immediate reduction of the participation grade.</p>

      <p>Throughout the semester students will be asked to write seven journal assignments in response to specific prompts. Each journal prompt will be assigned one class period prior to the due date, and each journal must be submitted <i>before or at the very beginning of class</i> in the appropriate discussion board on Canvas. The discussion board will close as soon as class begins, and late journals will not be accepted.</p>

      <p>Each journal entry should be 250-500 words unless otherwise specified on the journal prompt. A journal entry that responds fully and thoughtfully to the prompt will receive <b>1 point</b>. A journal entry that responds superficially to the prompt will receive <b>1/2 of a point</b>. A journal entry that does not respond to the prompt or fails to meet the length requirement will receive <b>zero points</b>.</p>

Project #1: Rhetorical Analysis (10%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">
        <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></span><br>
        A rhetorical analysis examines an author’s or creator’s attempt to communicate with and affect a specific audience. This project will require you to choose a text and craft a claim about why this text is rhetorically effective or otherwise rhetorically noteworthy.</p>

        <p><b>TEXT</b><br>
        There is considerable flexibility in the text you choose. The text might be oral, visual, literary, or multimedia. It might be produced by someone famous, like an NBA star, or someone anonymous, like a Reddit user. It might be 10,000 words, 240 characters, or it might consist solely of images. It might be a straightforward argument or a more implicit, understated attempt at inspiring action. However, there are a few constraints:<ul>
        <li>You must choose a text that was originally designed to be shared or communicated on the internet. You cannot choose a #MeToo protest sign, but you may choose a tweet, an Instagram post, or a YouTube video about a #MeToo protest sign. You may choose an article from an online publication, such as <i>Slate</i> or <i>Breitbart</i>; you may choose an article from a venue that publishes simultaneously online and in print, such as the <i>Daily Collegian</i>; but you may not choose an article from a print-only venue. </li>
        <li>You may not choose a fictional or primarily aesthetic text. For instance, do not choose a song or a scene from a Hollywood film (unless it’s a documentary).</li>
        <li>You may choose a text of any length or degree of complexity, but keep in mind that this is a relatively short assignment (~1200 words). It might be difficult to address all the rhetorical elements of a 2-hour documentary or a 200-page book in 1200 words. </li>
        <li>You must choose a text that interests you. One of the biggest problems students face during this assignment is that they don’t know why they chose their text. If the rhetorical elements of a text don’t grab your attention—if the text doesn’t intrigue you, or if you can’t find much to say about it—then don’t force yourself to write about it. Find a different text instead.</li></ul></p>
        <p>If you have any questions about these constraints, or if you are uncertain whether your chosen texts meets these criteria, please speak with me.</p>

        <p><b>EXPECTATIONS AND GRADING</b><br>
        1.) In the opening paragraph of your paper you must present your reader with a clear thesis statement. Your thesis statement should function as a template, offering the reader a preview of an argument that you plan to develop in the paragraphs that follow.</p>

        <p>2.) The argument you choose to make is up to you, but it must address some rhetorical aspect of your chosen text. Perhaps this text skillfully balances the expectations of multiple, conflicting audiences. Perhaps it offers a creative solution to overcome a pressing rhetorical constraint. Perhaps the text makes innovative use of rhetorical appeals, such as ethos or pathos. Perhaps it represents a particularly fitting response to a rhetorical opportunity.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that it is not enough merely to <i>describe</i> your text. You must craft an <i>argument</i> about the text’s rhetorical structure. It is often easy, for instance, to point out that an author uses pathos; it takes far more effort to make an argument about <i>why</i> pathos is particularly effective or ineffective in a given rhetorical situation. You do not have to argue that your text is perfect or the best rhetorical object of all time, but you do have to advance and defend a claim about its notability: why should readers care about the rhetorical strategy behind the text or the rhetorical situation surrounding it?</p>

        <p>3.) At some point in the introduction to your paper you must identify the rhetor, the intended audience, the message, and the intended purpose—or the who, the what, and the why—of your chosen text. Also, include any additional context that your reader might need to understand the text and rhetorical situation.</p>

        <p>4.) Each claim that you make about your text must be supported by evidence. If you believe that the rhetor is speaking to a particular audience, how do you know? If humor is an important component of the rhetor’s strategy, how do you know? As a rhetorical analyst, your job is not to <i>tell</i> us how the text works, but to <i>show</i> us through concrete examples.</p>

        <p><b>FORMAT</b><br>
        Your draft should be roughly 1200 words (4 pages). It should be double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and the font should be 12-point Times New Roman. When citing your chosen text (as well as any other sources), please follow MLA formatting guidelines. If you are unfamiliar with MLA, refer to the OWL (Online Writing Lab) at Purdue via Google. You should submit a printed, physical copy of your paper, bound with a staple or a paper clip.</p><br>

                                            </div></li><li>

                                            </li></ul>

        <p>Students must submit two drafts of every project (except for project #4). Draft #1 will be peer reviewed in class. Draft #2 will be submitted to me for a final grade. Journals will not be peer reviewed.</p>
        <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding these assignments, I will gladly discuss them with you.</p>


<h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>Writing is not a solitary process. In recognition of this fact, English 015 offers students ample opportunity to give and receive feedback through multiple peer review sessions.</p>

    <p>Peer review represents a unique phase of the writing process. During these sessions, students must rely on one another for support and guidance. Since peer review places each student's success directly into the hands of their classmates, it is imperative to show up to every peer review session prepared to participate. Exceptional participation during peer review can enhance a flagging participation grade, while lackluster or indifferent participation during peer review can damage an otherwise high participation grade.

    <p>Students are required to submit a draft of their project online before each peer review session. These drafts will not be graded, but they will be checked for general effort and completeness. An underdeveloped draft wastes the time of both the writer and the reviewers, and anyone who submits a draft shorter than <b>three full pages</b> may be asked to leave the peer review session. Of course, a peer review draft does not need to be polished. It might have gaps or untied threads. But each student must give their partners something substantial to work with.</p>

    <p>Each major project must be peer reviewed prior to submission. If a student misses a peer review session, it is their personal responsibility to arrange for a classmate to read and review their project. The peer-reviewed draft (with peer feedback attached) must be submitted along with the final draft of the project.</p>


<h2>Materials</h2>
 	<p>Please bring the following items to each class:</p>

	<ul><li><i>The assigned reading</i>.
		I do not care if you bring a physical or a so-called digital copy.
		Multiple failures to bring the reading will result in a diminished participation grade.</li><br>
	<li><i>Something to write on; something to write with</i>.
		I don’t care what the utensil is, and I don't
	   	care if the material happens to be scrap paper—I only care that
		you have something you can <i>physically</i> hand in.
		We will not be writing in every class, but please come prepared.</li></ul>

<h2>Nondiscrimination + Accommodations</h2>

		<p>I expect myself and everyone else to maintain a safe classroom environment. Discrimination or harassment of
			any form—and particularly on the basis of race, color, disability status, nationality, sexual and
			gender identity, or religion—will not be tolerated.</p>
 		<p>If you require any acommodations in order to participate in this course, please let me
	 	and/or Penn State's Student Disability Resources office know as soon as possible. It is your
		 right to have these accommodations met.</p>

Standard of Classroom Behavior

 	<p>Classroom behavior should always reflect the essential Penn State values of civility, integrity, and respect for the dignity and rights of others. As such, the classroom space should be safe, orderly, and positive—free from disruptions, disorderly conduct, and harassment as defined in the University Code of Conduct (studentaffairs.psu.edu/support-safety-conduct/student-conduct/code-conduct). The University Code of Conduct defines disruption “as an action or combination of actions by one or more individuals that unreasonably interferes with, hinders, obstructs, or prevents the operation of the University or infringes on the rights of others to freely participate in its programs and services;” disorderly conduct includes but is not limited to “creating unreasonable noise; pushing and shoving; creating a physically hazardous or physically offensive condition;” and harassment may include “directing physical or verbal conduct at an individual…; subjecting a person or group of persons to unwanted physical contact or threat of such; or engaging in a course of conduct, including following the person without proper authority (e.g., stalking), under circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or to suffer emotional distress” (Section IV, B). The course instructor has the authority to request that any disruptive students leave the class for the class period. If disruptive behavior continues in subsequent class periods, a complaint may be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which may result in the student being dismissed from class until University procedures have been completed. Any student with concerns or questions as to this policy should contact the Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric. </p></div></li></ul>
