<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>English 015 is an intensive, rhetorically-based course in reading and writing. It will prepare students to understand the communications that surround them and to succeed in their own communication efforts. Participants will spend the semester discussing rhetorical principles. They will use these principles to analyze verbal and visual texts produced by their peers and other authors, and they will apply these principles in their own writing.</p>

<p>English 015 is not a grammar course. It will not provide students with pre-designed templates or step-by-step guides for composing essays. Instead, English 015 will help students become more self-reflexive about the writing and communication habits they <i>already</i> bring to the classroom. The course is designed to make students more attuned to their goals as writers; more aware of how they communicate in their day-to-day lives; more resourceful in terms of the appropriate delivery of their information; more conscious of available rhetorical strategies; and more sensitive to the expectations and needs of their audience. Students who commit to earnest and thoughtful discussion, to experimentation and revision, and to critical peer- and self-evaluation will leave English 015 as more confident readers and writers.</p>

      <p>This course will be conducted in a seminar format, and a high participation grade will reflect regular, attentive, and thoughtful contributions to our discussion. Be prepared to ask questions, to make claims about the assigned reading, and to respond to other students' questions and claims.</p>
      <p>Discussion, like any other skill, requires time, patience, and practice to develop. Everyone is coming to this course with different levels of exposure to the course's concepts and with various ranges of experience in analyzing texts. My only expectation is that everyone will try to keep discussions generative and inclusive.</p>
      <p>Students are allowed <b>two absences</b> (the equivalent of one week of class). Additional absences will result in an immediate reduction of the participation grade.</p>

  <p>Throughout the semester students will be asked to write seven journal assignments in response to specific prompts. Each journal prompt will be assigned one class period prior to the due date, and each journal must be submitted <i>before or at the very beginning of class</i> in the appropriate discussion board on Canvas. The discussion board will close as soon as class begins, and late journals will not be accepted.</p>

  <p>Each journal entry should be 250-500 words unless otherwise specified on the journal prompt. A journal entry that responds fully and thoughtfully to the prompt will receive <b>1 point</b>. A journal entry that responds superficially to the prompt will receive <b>1/2 of a point</b>. A journal entry that does not respond to the prompt or fails to meet the length requirement will receive <b>zero points</b>.</p>

  <p><i><b>Due to the missed class Thursday 3/5, we will now only be writing <u>six</u> journals. The grading chart now reflects this change.</p></i></b>

Project #1: Rhetorical Analysis (10%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">
        <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></span><br>
        A rhetorical analysis examines an author’s or creator’s attempt to communicate with and affect a specific audience. This project will require you to choose a text and craft a claim about why this text is rhetorically effective or otherwise rhetorically noteworthy.</p>

        <p><b>TEXT</b><br>
        There is considerable flexibility in the text you choose. The text might be oral, visual, literary, or multimedia. It might be produced by someone famous, like an NBA star, or someone anonymous, like a Reddit user. It might be 10,000 words, 240 characters, or it might consist solely of images. It might be a straightforward argument or a more implicit, understated attempt at inspiring action. However, there are a few constraints:<ul>
        <li>You must choose a text that was originally designed to be shared or communicated on the internet. You cannot choose a #MeToo protest sign, but you may choose a tweet, an Instagram post, or a YouTube video about a #MeToo protest sign. You may choose an article from an online publication, such as <i>Slate</i> or <i>Breitbart</i>; you may choose an article from a venue that publishes simultaneously online and in print, such as the <i>Daily Collegian</i>; but you may not choose an article from a print-only venue. </li>
        <li>You may not choose a fictional or primarily aesthetic text. For instance, do not choose a song or a scene from a Hollywood film (unless it’s a documentary).</li>
        <li>You may choose a text of any length or degree of complexity, but keep in mind that this is a relatively short assignment (~1200 words). It might be difficult to address all the rhetorical elements of a 2-hour documentary or a 200-page book in 1200 words. </li>
        <li>You must choose a text that interests you. One of the biggest problems students face during this assignment is that they don’t know why they chose their text. If the rhetorical elements of a text don’t grab your attention—if the text doesn’t intrigue you, or if you can’t find much to say about it—then don’t force yourself to write about it. Find a different text instead.</li></ul></p>
        <p>If you have any questions about these constraints, or if you are uncertain whether your chosen texts meets these criteria, please speak with me.</p>

        <p><b>EXPECTATIONS AND GRADING</b><br>
        1.) In the opening paragraph of your paper you must present your reader with a clear thesis statement. Your thesis statement should function as a template, offering the reader a preview of an argument that you plan to develop in the paragraphs that follow.</p>

        <p>2.) The argument you choose to make is up to you, but it must address some rhetorical aspect of your chosen text. Perhaps this text skillfully balances the expectations of multiple, conflicting audiences. Perhaps it offers a creative solution to overcome a pressing rhetorical constraint. Perhaps the text makes innovative use of rhetorical appeals, such as ethos or pathos. Perhaps it represents a particularly fitting response to a rhetorical opportunity.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that it is not enough merely to <i>describe</i> your text. You must craft an <i>argument</i> about the text’s rhetorical structure. It is often easy, for instance, to point out that an author uses pathos; it takes far more effort to make an argument about <i>why</i> pathos is particularly effective or ineffective in a given rhetorical situation. You do not have to argue that your text is perfect or the best rhetorical object of all time, but you do have to advance and defend a claim about its notability: why should readers care about the rhetorical strategy behind the text or the rhetorical situation surrounding it?</p>

        <p>3.) At some point in the introduction to your paper you must identify the rhetor, the intended audience, the message, and the intended purpose—or the who, the what, and the why—of your chosen text. Also, include any additional context that your reader might need to understand the text and rhetorical situation.</p>

        <p>4.) Each claim that you make about your text must be supported by evidence. If you believe that the rhetor is speaking to a particular audience, how do you know? If humor is an important component of the rhetor’s strategy, how do you know? As a rhetorical analyst, your job is not to <i>tell</i> us how the text works, but to <i>show</i> us through concrete examples.</p>

        <p><b>FORMAT</b><br>
        Your draft should be roughly 1200 words (4 pages). It should be double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and the font should be 12-point Times New Roman. When citing your chosen text (as well as any other sources), please follow MLA formatting guidelines. If you are unfamiliar with MLA, refer to the OWL (Online Writing Lab) at Purdue via Google. You should submit a printed, physical copy of your paper, bound with a staple or a paper clip.</p><br>

Project #2: Evaluative Review (15%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">

<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></span><br>
        We make conscious and unconscious evaluations constantly. We might think someone’s outfit is “stylish,” that someone’s laptop is a “piece of junk,” that a politician has had a “shameful” career; we might debate whether Steve Jobs is “an inspiration” or “a fraud,” or whether Katy Perry’s latest album “slaps” or is “trash.” This project will require you to evaluate a product, person, experience, event, or some other object or phenomenon for a particular audience. You must justify your evaluation by identifying a distinct <i>category</i> for your object and explicit <i>criteria</i> for your analysis.</p>

<p><b>OBJECT OF ANALYSIS</b><br>
        There is considerable flexibility in the object you choose. You might evaluate Chipotle or UGG Boots or Eric Barron or a building on campus. However, please refrain from choosing a primarily aesthetic or fictional object. Although you might feel moved to evaluate the latest Marvel film or Kanye West album, criteria for evaluating these objects are often far too subjective and/or impressionistic to suit the purpose of this particular assignment.</p>

        <p>Your brainstorming should be thorough. Try to come up with a range of possible objects to evaluate, as the first idea that comes to mind might not be your best. Focus on selecting an object that is significant, misunderstood, or undervalued—something that actually calls for a fresh evaluation.</p>

<p><b>CATEGORY / CRITERIA / AUDIENCE</b><br>
        You must situate your object within a distinct <b>category</b> of analysis. For instance, you might evaluate Starbucks as a “coffee shop” or a “study space,” but you also might evaluate it as a “multinational corporation” or a “first job.” The category you choose may drastically affect your evaluation. Starbucks might be an excellent “study space” but a terrible “first job.”</p>

        <p>You must identify explicit <b>criteria</b> for evaluating objects in your category. For instance, if you are evaluating Starbucks as a “study space,” what are some criteria you would consider when judging any study space? These might include access to wi-fi, snacks, noise—it is up to you to identify and argue for reasonable criteria.</p>

        <p>Your criteria must address a specific <b>audience</b> who can act upon or respond to your evaluation. An engineering major at Penn State, a finance executive on Wall Street, and a professional coffee connoisseur will all have different reasons for using and assessing a coffee shop. Who are you writing your evaluation for, and how does your criteria respond to <i>their</i> needs and desires?</p>

<p><b>EXPECTATIONS AND GRADING</b><br>
          1.) Your evaluation should identify a strong reason (exigence) for evaluating your chosen object or phenomenon. You should not assume that your readers are automatically interested in your opinion; you should craft an <i>argument</i> about why this object/phenomenon would benefit from a fresh evaluation.</p>

          <p>2.) Your evaluation should address and appeal to an audience who will benefit from, be interested in, or contribute somehow to this evaluation.</p>

          <p>3.) You must define a precise category of analysis with clear and reasonable criteria. Keep in mind that, often, it is insufficient merely to present or list your criteria; a strong evaluation will address why the chosen criteria are reasonable given the rhetorical situation. Finally, you should provide concrete evidence and examples that illustrate how your chosen object or phenomenon meets or does not meet these criteria.</p>

          <p>4.) You must identify a hypothetical venue for your evaluation, and this venue should be available through the internet. Do you envision yourself writing for a review website like Yelp or Amazon? Or perhaps for a student-centered publication such as the <i>Daily Collegian</i>, or a more general media outlet such as <i>BuzzFeed</i> or <i>Vox</i>? Or is the venue more personal, such as a blog or a Reddit post? You should select a venue that is appropriate for both the object you’re evaluating and the audience you’re trying to reach.</p>

<p><b>FORMAT</b><br>

        Your draft should be roughly 1200 words (4 pages). It should be double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and the font should be 12-point Times New Roman. When citing external sources, please follow MLA formatting guidelines. If you are unfamiliar with MLA, refer to the OWL (Online Writing Lab) at Purdue via Google. You should submit a printed, physical copy of your paper, bound with a staple or a paper clip.</p><br>

Project #3: Position Argument (15%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">

<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></span><br>
        A position argument makes a case for how readers should view or relate to a particular subject. This project will require you to research an issue (a pre-existing problem, idea, debate, or event), take a <i>position</i> with respect to this issue, and then <i>argue</i> or <i>justify</i> this position for a particular audience.</p>

<p><b>ISSUE</b></span><br>
        There is considerable flexibility in the issue you choose, but you should try to select something that affects you or a community to which you belong. Think locally, rather than globally. You are more likely to make a strong, insightful, and fresh argument about issues affecting your hometown, your family, or your classmates than issues affecting some vague audience such as “the nation” or “the world.”</p>

<p><b>POSITION</b></span><br>

        “Position” is a relational concept: we understand <i>up</i> in relation to <i>down</i>, <i>near</i> in relation to <i>far</i>, <i>East</i> in relation to <i>West</i>. If you want to take a position on a particular issue, then your position can only be fully understood <i>in relation to other positions</i>. No matter the issue you choose for your project, you will need to investigate a larger conversation; specifically, you will need to find at least one assessment, statement, summation, evaluation—i.e., one <i>position</i>—on this issue, to which you will directly respond in your writing. You might find this position in a news story, a twitter thread, a poster on campus, a comment section, an email, a letter from a politician—you are limited only by what you can cite. You do not necessarily have to disagree with this position, but you cannot simply copy or reiterate it. You must articulate your own position in relation to this previous position. </p>

<p><b>GENRE</b></span><br>

        The genre for this project is up to you. You might choose to write in the form of an op-ed, suitable for <i>Onward State</i> or <i>The Daily Collegian</i>. You might choose to write a measured “think piece” or a more controversial “hot take.” You can write in the form of a response—or, if you prefer, a series of responses—in a comment section, a Reddit thread, or some other online discussion forum.  You might decide to write a Change.org petition, or some other specialized form. Whatever genre you choose, it should be suitable for your particular audience. Who are you trying to reach with your position, and how does the form of your writing help accomplish this? <p>

<p><b>EXPECTATIONS AND GRADING</b></span><br>

        1.) Your project must clearly define an issue: a pre-existing problem, idea, debate, or event.</p>

        <p>2.) Your project must identify and summarize an existing position on this issue. You must respond to this position with your own position. You must provide a convincing, rhetorically effective argument for your position, drawing upon specific details, examples, and appropriate outside research for support. </p>

        <p>3.) You must address a specific audience who can benefit from, respond to, or somehow be affected by your position.</p>

<p><b>FORMAT</b></span><br>
        Your draft should be roughly 1350 words (4.5 pages). If you choose to write multiple short responses—as in a discussion forum—you should identify who, specifically, you are responding to, and your cumulative responses should reach the minimum word limit. The draft should be double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and the font should be 12-point Times New Roman. When citing external sources, please follow MLA formatting guidelines. If you are unfamiliar with MLA, refer to the OWL (Online Writing Lab) at Purdue via Google. You should submit a printed, physical copy of your paper, bound with a staple or a paper clip.</p><br>

Project #4: Wiki Article (15%)
                             </button><div class="panel">
<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></span><br>
        A wiki is a website that relies on its users to write, publish, update, and edit its content. This project will require you to work collaboratively with your peers to produce a wiki article. This article should describe and rank—or provide a “power ranking”—of snack foods for a particular audience.</p>

<p><b>RANKING</b></span><br>
        This assignment will require you to draw on some components from the evaluative review assignment from earlier in the semester. In particular, it will require to draw on the concept of evaluative “criteria.” There are no prerequisites for the criteria you bring to bear on this assignment. As long as these criteria are explicit and suitable for your audience, you can rank these snack foods in whatever manner you find appropriate.  </p>
        <p>It is important, however, that these criteria are consistently applied to each snack food. The initial draft of each subsection that you submit to your wiki may have little or absolutely nothing to do with the criteria chosen by your group, and you will collectively have to edit these subsections to bring them all into alignment.</p>

<p><b>ARTICLE</b></span><br>
        Your article must consist of an introduction and either 4 or 5 subsections, depending on the size of your group. Each group member will be responsible for writing an initial draft of exactly one subsection. Once you submit your initial draft to the wiki, <i>do not edit it</i>. You may edit your partners’ subsections, and they may edit your subsection, but nobody should edit the subsection they originally submitted.</p>
        <p>Wikis are inherently collaborative. Anyone who contributes to a wiki should expect that their writing will someday be compressed, edited, or even deleted. Nobody “owns” or “authors” a wiki article on their own, and the above constraint will require you to embrace this sometimes uncomfortable or unintuitive aspect of the wiki-writing process.  </p>
        <p>Each subsection should: describe a snack food; address any particular relevance it might have (or not have) for your chosen audience; and highlight its strengths and/or weaknesses with respect to your chosen criteria. There is plenty of other information you might include, but this will depend on your audience and criteria. </p>

<p><b>TALK SECTION</b></span><br>
      You and your peers will have to make numerous editorial decisions regarding the final form and content of your wiki article. What guiding principles will you use to organize the subsections? And how will you modify each subsection to meet these organizational principles? How you choose to answer these questions is ultimately up to your group, but you and your group members should <i>not</i> address them verbally (i.e., face-to-face). Instead, any editorial suggestions and/or decisions should be proposed and discussed in the wiki entry’s “talk” section.</p>

<p><b>AUDIENCE(S)</b></span><br>
      While previous writing projects in this course have only required you to address one audience, this project will require you to address two. On the one hand, you will have to address your article to a specific audience of readers who might be interested in your topic. On the other hand, you will have to address your “talk” section to your peers and collaborators. </p>

<p><b>EXPECTATIONS AND GRADING</b></span><br>
      1.) Your article must list 4-5 snack foods (one for each member of the group) and rank them. The criteria you use to rank these snack foods should be clearly identified and briefly justified somewhere in the introduction to the article.</p>

      <p>2.) Your article must address and appeal to an audience who will benefit from, be interested in, or contribute somehow to the topic. It is up to you and your group members to choose a specific audience.</p>

      <p>3.) You and your partners must civilly propose, discuss, and reach a consensus on proper guidelines for editing your wiki article. Any major editorial adjustments or editorial disputes must be civilly discussed in your wiki page’s “talk” section. </p>

      <p>4.) Each partner must help to edit the wiki article. Some partners may contribute more than others, and I do not have strict guidelines for minimum engagement, but I will consult your article’s editorial “view history” page to make sure that everyone has contributed something. </p>

      <p>Since this is a collaborative project without a physical "final draft" in the traditional sense, I will be using a rubric to calculate grades and deliver individualized feedback. You can find a copy of that rubric <a href="rubric.pdf" target="_blank">at this link</a>.

<p><b>FORMAT</b></span><br>
      Your article will be hosted on Wikipedia. At least one of your group members must open a Wikipedia account, and your article should be drafted, edited, and published on this member’s “Sandbox” page. Keep in mind that, although you are hosting your wiki article on Wikipedia, you are not writing a Wikipedia article. The goals of this assignment and the editorial criteria you and your partners choose are markedly different from the goals and criteria of a typical Wikipedia entry. </p>

      <p>Each subsection of the wiki article should be roughly 250-500 words. Links should be formatted and sources should be cited in accordance with Wikipedia’s guidelines. Each partner should clearly indicate their Wikipedia handle or username on your page’s “talk” section. A link to your article should be submitted to me through Canvas.</p><br>

Project #5: Meme + Cover Letter (15%)
                             </button><div class="panel">

<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></span><br>
        A meme is an image and/or text that spreads and typically evolves through selective duplication, transmission, imitation, variation, and divergence from an original model. This project will require you to create a meme of your own. You will also write a cover letter that explains the rhetorical situation and justifies your rhetorical decisions.</p>

<p><b>MEME</b></span><br>
        Since anything that can be copied and transmitted can potentially become meme-ified, it is difficult to set clear guidelines for constructing a meme. However, most successful memes can be rapidly consumed and easily repurposed. This means you will want to keep your meme relatively simple and concise. Avoid cluttering your meme with unnecessary nuance or detail. Note, for instance: a 4-page essay cannot be rapidly consumed; an elaborate Bruegel-style painting cannot be easily repurposed. As a guide, you might limit yourself to whatever can fit in a 240-character tweet, or what can easily be viewed in an Instagram post.</p>

        <p>You have the option either to find and adapt a pre-existing meme or to create a new meme from scratch. You will not be graded on your artistic or technical skills. I do not expect anyone to create the world’s funniest or most viral piece of internet content. As long as you can provide proper justification in your cover letter, your meme can be almost anything.</p>

<p><b>COVER LETTER</b></span><br>
        Your cover letter should answer two questions. First, what is the rhetorical opportunity that your meme is responding to? Related questions you might consider are: What is the exigence that inspired your meme? Who is the audience you would like your meme to reach, and why did you choose this audience? What effect would you like this meme to have on your audience? Why is a meme a rhetorically effective medium for this particular rhetorical situation?</p>

        <p>Second, what rhetorical choices went into the construction of your meme? Related questions you might consider are: How does your meme reflect the needs or expectations of your particular audience? How does your meme reflect the exigence that inspired it? What relationship, if any, does your meme have to previous memes? If you made this meme from scratch, how did you ensure that it could be rapidly consumed and easily repurposed? When answering these questions, make sure to refer to concrete examples and details from your meme.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the cover letter is itself a rhetorical document. You should not simply describe the rhetorical choices you made; you should create an <i>argument</i> about why these choices are rhetorically effective.</p>

<p><b>EXPECTATIONS AND GRADING</b></span><br>
        1.) Your meme should be an image and/or text that readers can rapidly consume and easily repurpose. Beyond this, there are very few explicit guidelines for your meme—everything else depends on your exigence and your audience.</p>

        <p>2.) Your meme must have rhetorically appropriate exigence. It must be addressed to a rhetorically appropriate audience.</p>

        <p>3.) Your cover letter must explain the rhetorical situation and justify (i.e., argue for) the rhetorical decisions that guided the construction of your meme.</p>

<p><b>FORMAT</b></span><br>
        Your cover letter should be <i>at least</i> 750 words (2.5 pages). You should submit a copy of your meme and your cover letter online through Canvas. Unless your meme is animated, you should submit the meme and cover letter together in a single document.</p>

                    </li></ul>

        <p>Students must submit two drafts of every project (except for project #4). Draft #1 will be peer reviewed in class. Draft #2 will be submitted to me for a final grade. Journals will not be peer reviewed.</p>
        <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding these assignments, I will gladly discuss them with you.</p>


<h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>Writing is not a solitary process. In recognition of this fact, English 015 offers students ample opportunity to give and receive feedback through multiple peer review sessions.</p>

    <p>Peer review represents a unique phase of the writing process. During these sessions, students must rely on one another for support and guidance. Since peer review places each student's success directly into the hands of their classmates, it is imperative to show up to every peer review session prepared to participate. Exceptional participation during peer review can enhance a flagging participation grade, while lackluster or indifferent participation during peer review can damage an otherwise high participation grade.

    <p>Students are required to submit a draft of their project online before each peer review session. These drafts will not be graded, but they will be checked for general effort and completeness. An underdeveloped draft wastes the time of both the writer and the reviewers, and anyone who submits a draft shorter than <b>three full pages</b> may be asked to leave the peer review session. Of course, a peer review draft does not need to be polished. It might have gaps or untied threads. But each student must give their partners something substantial to work with.</p>

    <p>Each major project must be peer reviewed prior to submission. If a student misses a peer review session, it is their personal responsibility to arrange for a classmate to read and review their project. The peer-reviewed draft (with peer feedback attached) must be submitted along with the final draft of the project.</p>


<h2>Materials</h2>
 	<p>Please bring the following items to each class:</p>

	<ul><li><i>The assigned reading</i>.
		I do not care if you bring a physical or a so-called digital copy.
		Multiple failures to bring the reading will result in a diminished participation grade.</li><br>
	<li><i>Something to write on; something to write with</i>.
		I don’t care what the utensil is, and I don't
	   	care if the material happens to be scrap paper—I only care that
		you have something you can <i>physically</i> hand in.
		We will not be writing in every class, but please come prepared.</li></ul>

<h2>Nondiscrimination + Accommodations</h2>

		<p>I expect myself and everyone else to maintain a safe classroom environment. Discrimination or harassment of
			any form—and particularly on the basis of race, color, disability status, nationality, sexual and
			gender identity, or religion—will not be tolerated.</p>
 		<p>If you require any acommodations in order to participate in this course, please let me
	 	and/or Penn State's Student Disability Resources office know as soon as possible. It is your

Standard of Classroom Behavior

 	<p>Classroom behavior should always reflect the essential Penn State values of civility, integrity, and respect for the dignity and rights of others. As such, the classroom space should be safe, orderly, and positive—free from disruptions, disorderly conduct, and harassment as defined in the University Code of Conduct (studentaffairs.psu.edu/support-safety-conduct/student-conduct/code-conduct). The University Code of Conduct defines disruption “as an action or combination of actions by one or more individuals that unreasonably interferes with, hinders, obstructs, or prevents the operation of the University or infringes on the rights of others to freely participate in its programs and services;” disorderly conduct includes but is not limited to “creating unreasonable noise; pushing and shoving; creating a physically hazardous or physically offensive condition;” and harassment may include “directing physical or verbal conduct at an individual…; subjecting a person or group of persons to unwanted physical contact or threat of such; or engaging in a course of conduct, including following the person without proper authority (e.g., stalking), under circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or to suffer emotional distress” (Section IV, B). The course instructor has the authority to request that any disruptive students leave the class for the class period. If disruptive behavior continues in subsequent class periods, a complaint may be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which may result in the student being dismissed from class until University procedures have been completed. Any student with concerns or questions as to this policy should contact the Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric. </p></div></li></ul>
